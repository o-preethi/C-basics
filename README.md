# C-basics
learning C language from basics to building projects(restarting from strach)

#avg- 
in my very first code of c language I chose to write a program of grading system. in this i chose a maximum of 5 subjects but the code works
for any number of subjects. based on number of subjects,score in the each subject,grades are allocated along with the average of the marks in all subjects 
in this I used the variable noofgrades to store the total number of subjects the candidate is appearing. based on that i wrote a for loop to save grades of all the subjects in the array grades. which are further added together in the variable sum which i used as integer value then to find the average i divided the total sum with the noofgrades variable to get the variable which is a decimal value but I preferred to keep it integer without using type conversion. then assigned the grades used a seperate function

-ARRAYS,LOOPS,DATA TYPES,FUNCTIONS,COMPARISON AND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

#simplecalculator-

I created a code where it reads 2 input variables in the float and a character which is the arithematic operator. in which I used the switch case to compare the character to the case and perform operations accordingly in each code block

this calculator performs addition,subtraction,multiplication.divison.
