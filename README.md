learning C language from basics to building projects(restarting from strach)

#avg- 
in my very first code of c language I chose to write a program of grading system. in this i chose a maximum of 5 subjects but the code works
for any number of subjects. based on number of subjects,score in the each subject,grades are allocated along with the average of the marks in all subjects
